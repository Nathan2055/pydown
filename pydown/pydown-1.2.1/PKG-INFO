Description: ===========
        pydown
        ===========
        
        Pydown is a library for downloading files from the Internet. It also includes a simple textual interface. I have currently written it as my first production use program, so I'm keeping it in a state of perpetual beta until I'm absolutley sure it works. Install it using your preferred method of getting Python packages and then open the interface simply by calling it with no arguments or use its functions in your own code.
        
        Todo list
        ===========
        * Implement a website with information and bugtrackers
        * Allow users to pass URLs as command line arguments and have it quickly download them
        * Implement a function for compressing downloaded files
        * Seperate code into multiple individual Python source files
        
        Changelog
        =========

        v1.1
        -------------

        v1.0.1
